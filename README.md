# gravity_star
A generative art project about painting singularities: each piece in the **Gravity Star** collection was produced from a single seed image. A combination of techniques conjures stars from the nether, shining like digital poetry.

Producing **Gravity Stars** requires a randomized algorithm and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). 

Diamonds in rhizomatic space, gravity stars explode into a blend of digital and analog art processes.

## Project Requirements
- Python 3.9 or above
- [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- numpy

It is recommneded that you create a new environemnt to install the project dependencies. Running gravity_star.py will result in the creation of a new star, saved with a random name and id. 

All gravity stars are created using the same image: bouyant.jpg, which is included with the project.
